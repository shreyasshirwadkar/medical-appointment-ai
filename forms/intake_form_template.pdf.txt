This is a placeholder for the New Patient Intake Form PDF.

In a real implementation, this would be the actual PDF form that patients need to complete before their appointment.

The form would typically include:

- Personal Information
- Medical History
- Current Medications
- Allergies
- Insurance Information
- Emergency Contacts
- Consent Forms

This file would be attached to confirmation emails and sent to patients automatically after booking confirmation.
